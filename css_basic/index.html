          Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical
          goals in a reproducible way. [1] The word technology can also mean the
          products resulting from such efforts, [2]: 117 [3] including both
          tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such
          as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering,
          and everyday life.
